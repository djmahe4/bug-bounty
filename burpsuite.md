# 🚀 Rapid Vulnerability Discovery with Burp Suite  
_Using the “Payload Chaining” Method for Quick Wins_

## 📋 Overview
This guide shows how to:
- Spot **small, low‑impact bugs** quickly in Burp Suite.
- Chain them into **critical exploits** (e.g., account takeover).
- Document them for **fast triage and higher bounties**.

---

## 1️⃣ Setup Burp Suite for Speed

### Extensions to Install
- **Logger++** – Track all requests/responses.
- **Active Scan++** – Enhanced scanning for edge cases.
- **Param Miner** – Discover hidden parameters.
- **JWT Editor** – Decode, modify, and re‑sign JWTs.

### Proxy & Scope
- Add target domains (including staging/beta) to **Target → Scope**.
- Enable **Proxy → Intercept** to capture all traffic.
- Turn on **HTTP history** logging.

---

## 2️⃣ Recon Inside Burp

### A. Find Forgotten Subdomains
- Use **Burp’s Target tab** to spot unusual hosts.
- Compare with external recon (e.g., `subfinder`, `amass`) and add missing ones to scope.

### B. Identify Open Redirects
- Search HTTP history for params like:
  ```
  next=
  redirect=
  returnUrl=
  ```
- Send suspicious requests to **Repeater** and test with:
  ```
  https://evil.com
  //evil.com
  /\\evil.com
  ```

### C. Spot CSRF Gaps
- Filter for `POST`/`PUT` requests with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Check if they lack CSRF tokens but still accept authenticated cookies.

---

## 3️⃣ Quick Vulnerability Checks

| Bug Type | Burp Action | What to Look For |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Open Redirect** | Modify redirect param in Repeater | Redirects to your domain without validation |
| **JWT Misconfig** | Use JWT Editor to set `alg=none` or re‑sign with guessed key | Server accepts modified token |
| **CSRF Missing** | Replay POST without CSRF token | Request still succeeds |
| **Staging/Prod Session Reuse** | Log in on staging, reuse cookie on prod | Session accepted |

---

## 4️⃣ Chaining in Burp

Example chain from the article:
1. **Login to staging** → capture session cookie in Proxy.
2. **Open redirect** → change `next=` to your domain, forward request.
3. **Cookie exfiltration** → your server logs the staging cookie.
4. **Reuse cookie** → send it in a prod request via Repeater.
5. **CSRF‑less POST** → change victim’s email/password.

💡 **Tip:** Use **Burp’s Repeater tabs** to keep each step of the chain separate and reproducible.

---

## 5️⃣ Document as You Go

- **Save Repeater tabs** with descriptive names (`1-login-staging`, `2-open-redirect`, etc.).
- **Copy raw requests/responses** into your notes.
- **Screenshot** Burp tabs showing successful exploitation.

---

## 6️⃣ Reporting for Maximum Impact

When you write the report:
- Show **each bug individually**.
- Then show **the chain** and final impact.
- Include **fix recommendations**:
  - Remove unused subdomains.
  - Validate redirect targets.
  - Enforce CSRF tokens.
  - Isolate staging/prod sessions.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Burp Suite can **replace half your recon scripts** if you filter and search smartly.
- **Small bugs matter** — log them all, then look for ways to connect them.
- Always **test staging and beta** environments; they often have weaker security.

---

# ⚡ Burp Suite macro + custom logger setup

## 🎯 Goal
Configure Burp Suite so that as you browse a target, it **automatically highlights**:
- Open redirect parameters
- Requests missing CSRF tokens
- JWTs in headers or bodies

This way, you don’t have to manually sift through every request — Burp will surface the juicy ones.

---

## 1️⃣ Install Key Extensions

Go to **Extender → BApp Store** and install:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Logger++** | Real‑time request/response logging with filters |
| **Param Miner** | Finds hidden parameters, including redirect params |
| **JWT Editor** | Detects, decodes, and lets you modify JWTs |
| **Active Scan++** | Adds extra passive/active checks |

---

## 2️⃣ Configure Logger++ Filters

1. **Open Logger++ → Filters → Add**
2. Create **three filters**:

### A. Open Redirect Detector
- **Match Type:** Request
- **Match Regex:**  
  ```
  (next|redirect|returnUrl)=
  ```
- **Action:** Highlight in **red** and tag as `OpenRedirectParam`

### B. Missing CSRF Token
- **Match Type:** Request
- **Condition:** `Method = POST` or `PUT`
- **Negative Match:** `csrf|token` in request body or headers
- **Action:** Highlight in **orange** and tag as `NoCSRF`

### C. JWT Finder
- **Match Type:** Request or Response
- **Match Regex:**  
  ```
  eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*
  ```
- **Action:** Highlight in **blue** and tag as `JWT`

---

## 3️⃣ Param Miner Auto‑Mining

- Right‑click the target host in **Target tab** → **Extensions → Param Miner → Guess params**.
- Let it run in the background — it will surface hidden params (often including redirect vectors).

---

## 4️⃣ JWT Editor Auto‑Decode

- With JWT Editor installed, any JWT in a request/response will be **underlined**.
- Click it to decode instantly.
- Test `alg=none` or re‑sign with your cracked/guessed key directly in Burp.

---

## 5️⃣ Passive Scan Alerts

- In **Project Options → Scanning → Passive Scanning**, ensure:
  - “Scan all traffic” is enabled.
  - “Log interesting items” is checked.
- Active Scan++ will add extra checks for weak JWT secrets, missing security headers, etc.

---

## 6️⃣ Workflow in Action

1. **Browse normally** through the target in your browser with Burp proxy on.
2. Logger++ will **light up** with color‑coded hits:
   - 🔴 Red = possible open redirect param
   - 🟠 Orange = POST/PUT without CSRF token
   - 🔵 Blue = JWT detected
3. Click the hit → Send to **Repeater** for manual testing.
4. Chain findings:
   - Open redirect → steal cookie → reuse in prod → CSRF‑less POST → account takeover.

---

## 7️⃣ Bonus: Save & Reuse Filters

- In Logger++, export your filter set as `bbh-fast-hunt.json`.
- Import it into new projects so you’re always ready to hunt.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips
- Combine with **Burp’s search** (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to find all instances of a param across history.
- Use **Target → Site Map → Filter** to focus only on in‑scope hosts.
- Keep **Repeater tabs** named and ordered to document your chain.

Got it — here’s a **ready‑to‑import Logger++ filter set** in JSON so you can drop it straight into Burp Suite and instantly get the real‑time highlighting we discussed.  

---

## 📦 Logger++ Filter JSON

Save this as `bbh-fast-hunt.json` and import it in **Logger++ → Filters → Import**.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "OpenRedirectParam",
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "request",
    "match": "(?i)(next|redirect|returnUrl)=",
    "negativeMatch": "",
    "color": "#FF0000",
    "comment": "Possible open redirect parameter"
  },
  {
    "name": "NoCSRF",
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "request",
    "match": "(?i)^POST|PUT",
    "negativeMatch": "(?i)(csrf|token)",
    "color": "#FFA500",
    "comment": "POST/PUT without CSRF token"
  },
  {
    "name": "JWT",
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "both",
    "match": "eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*",
    "negativeMatch": "",
    "color": "#0000FF",
    "comment": "JWT detected in request or response"
  }
]
```

## 🛠 How to Import in Burp Suite

1. Go to **Extender → Extensions → Logger++ → Filters**.
2. Click **Import** and select `bbh-fast-hunt.json`.
3. Make sure all three filters are **enabled**.
4. Start browsing your target — hits will be color‑coded:
   - 🔴 **Red** = Possible open redirect parameter
   - 🟠 **Orange** = POST/PUT without CSRF token
   - 🔵 **Blue** = JWT detected

---

## ⚡ Hunting Workflow with These Filters

- **Red hit** → Send to Repeater → Test redirect payloads (`https://evil.com`, `//evil.com`, `/\\evil.com`).
- **Orange hit** → Replay without CSRF token → See if request still succeeds.
- **Blue hit** → Use JWT Editor to try `alg=none` or re‑sign with guessed/cracked key.
